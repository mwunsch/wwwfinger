I'm learning Rust by implementing a WebFinger client.
http://webfinger.net/

From the WebFinger spec (http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7033):

    WebFinger is used to discover information about people or other
    entities on the Internet that are identified by a URI [6] using
    standard Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) [2] methods over a secure
    transport [12].  A WebFinger resource returns a JavaScript Object
    Notation (JSON) [5] object describing the entity that is queried.
    The JSON object is referred to as the JSON Resource Descriptor (JRD).


This is a command line utility designed to slurp down the JSON Resource 
Descriptor and put it on stdout. Not much to it right now. The code is pretty 
ugly, but it's been a fun learning exercise.

It's not anywhere close to being "done". The cli is halfway implemented.
I don't think I'm being very smart about pointers/boxes/ownership right now.
I hope to eventually provide some typesafety around the JRD as well.

There's some code to fallback to WebFist (http://webfist.org/) but it's not 
implemented (you'll get dead code warnings when you try to build). 

This relies on rust-http and rust-openssl libraries, using git submodules 
until a better dependency management toolset exists.

Here's the command I use to run it:
    ./build.sh && target/wwwfinger acct:mark@markwunsch.com

You have to build the dependencies separatly. I'll write a Makefile
eventually.

Okay, have fun.
